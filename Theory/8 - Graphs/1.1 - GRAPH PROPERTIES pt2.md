# Graph Properties and Definitions pt2
Here we regroup some definitions which are fundamental to get started on graph theory.

## Let's consider Vertices

### Neighborhood
We can also consider it as the count of direct neighbors of the vertex u, 
as the count of vertex that can be directly reached with one edge from u.

Formally, given u ∈ V
* N(u)={v∈V | (u,v) ∈ E}

### Degree of vertex - Undirected graphs
Given an **undirected graph** G=(V,E), if we consider one of its vertices u ∈ V,
the number of edges incident to u is the degree of that vertex.
* deg(u) = |N(u)|, with **deg(u) ∈ [0,n-1]**
  * If the vertex has a degree of 0, then it is an isolated vertex.
  * If the vertex has a degree of 1, then it is a terminal vertex
  * Since there are no self-loops the maximum deg(u) is n-1.

It is not possible to construct an undirected graph where all the vertices' degrees are 
distinct.

### Out-Degree/In-Degree of vertex - Directed graphs
Given a directed graph G=(V,E), the degree of a vertex u **depends on the entering/leaving edges** related to u.
* Out-Degree of a Vertex, is the count of edges leaving that vertex.
* In-Degree of a Vertex, is the count of edges entering that vertex.

We can derive that: **sum(in-deg(u), u∈V) = sum(out-deg(u), u∈V) = m = |E|**

## Handshake Lemma
Let G be an undirected graph G=(V,E), with n=|V| and m=|E|
* <mark>`sum(deg(u), u∈V) = 2m`</mark>
  * We always obtain an **even** number for a sum of every degree
  * Also, it is two times the number of edges
* `m = 1/2 * sum(deg(u))`

Why is this true? Demonstration
* We know graph can always be represented by an Adjacency Matrix 
  * Let's say V={1,2,...,n}, to calculate deg(i) we just need to sum the i-th row's elements.
  * `deg(i) = sum(a(i,j), j= 1 to n)`  
* `sum(deg(i), i= 1 to n) = sum(sum(a(i,j), j = 1 to n), i = 1 to n) = 2m`

Here are some trivial consequences of this Lemma:

### Property 1
In an undirected graph G, the **#vertices of odd degree is always even**.

Demonstration: given an undirected graph G=(V,E)
* V can be divided in P,D such that V= P U D and
* P = {u∈V| deg(u) is even or 2k = deg(u)}
* D = {u∈V| deg(u) is odd or 2k+1 = deg(u)}

Then:

![dem prop 1](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms/blob/main/Resources/demprop1.png?raw=TRUE)

So 2m = 2*sum(h(u), u∈V) + |D|
* |D| = 2m - 2sum(h(u),u∈V) = 2(m-2sum(h(u),u∈V) 
* |D| is an integer and is even.
  * We are not interested in what sum(h(u), u∈V) is, it does not change the outcome

### Property 2: K-Regular Graph
Let G be an undirected graph G=(V,E) and integer k, we say that G is <mark>*k-regular*
if ∀u∈V: deg(u) = k</mark>
* If all vertices have the same degree k.
  * A 3-regular graph is a cubical graph 

Here are some examples:

2-regular graphs have deg(u)=2
* 2m = sum(deg(u)) = 2n
  * **m = n!** in a 2-regular graph

3-regular graphs have deg(u)=3
* 2m = sum(deg(u)) = 3n
  * 2m = 3n = 2n + n
  * n = 2(m-n), so **n is even in a 3-regular graph**

4-regular graphs have deg(u)=4
* 2m = sum(deg(u)) = 4n
  * m = 2n, **m is even and it is always 2n in 4-regular graph**

### Property 3
Let G be an undirected graph G=(V,E) without isolated vertices. We suppose
|E| = |V|-1, so m=n-1

Let V1 = {u∈V| deg(u)=1}

We can demonstrate that there exist at least two vertices with degree equal to 1 (terminal vertices), |V1|>=2
* m = n -1 --> 2n-2 = 2m
* 2n-2 = 2m = sum(deg(u), u∈V) 
* sum(deg(u), u∈V) = sum(deg(u), u∈V1) + sum(deg(u), u∈{V\V1})
* |V1| + sum(deg(u), u∈{V\V1}) >= |V1| + 2|V\V1| = |V1| + 2|V| - 2|V1|
* 2n - 2 >= |V1| - 2n - 2|V1| -> -2 >= |V1| - 2|V1| -> **|V1|>= 2**
