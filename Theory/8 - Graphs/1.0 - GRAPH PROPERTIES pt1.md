# Graph Properties and Definitions pt1
Here we regroup some definitions which are fundamental to get started on graph theory.

## Let's consider Edges

### Dense/Tight Graph - $|E| \approx |V|^{2} \approx n^{2}$
Simply put, a **dense/tight** graph are those for which $|E|$ is close to $|V|^2$.

### Sparse Graph - $|E| \approx |V| \approx n$
Simply put, a **sparse** graph are those for which |E| is much less 
than |V|^2 (usually close to |V|).

## Subgraph
A subgraph H is a pair composed of a **subset of vertices** and a **subset of edges**

A subgraph G' = (V', E') is a subgraph of G = (V,E) if:
* V' ‚äÜ V
* E' **‚äÜ** E ‚ãÇ V' x V'
  * Not all edges
  * Not all vertices must be connected between them.

## Induced Subgraph
A subgraph induced by a subset V'‚äÜ V, <mark>G[V']</mark>, is a subgraph G' = (V', E') such that:
* V' ‚äÜ V
* E' **=** E ‚ãÇ V' x V'
  * All the edges from the subset must connect all the vertices in V'

We can also use G[V'] to express that is a subgraph induced by V'

---

## Path
Let:
* $G = (V,E)$ be graph 
* $u,v \in V$ be two vertices in V

A <mark>path $p$ is a sequence of vertices $p = < x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{q} > $ </mark> where
1. $x_{0} = u$
2. $x_{q} = v$
3. $(x_{i-1}, x_{i}) \in E, \forall i = 1, \ldots, q$.
   1. They all must be connected by arches
   
Here we find an example:

### Sub-Path
Given a path $p = < x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k} > $ a sub-path of p, 
* $p' = < x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}, \ldots , x_{j} >$ where $0 \leq i \leq j \leq k`

### Intermediate Vertices
An intermediate vertex of a simple path p=<v1, v2,...vi> is any vertex of p other than v1 or vi,
that is, any vertex in the set {v2, v3, ..., vi-1}

Ex: A path p `1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 7 -> 9`, is a path p‚àà_D_ (1,9).
* `2 -> 4 -> 7` is the subgraph containing the intermediate vertices

### Simple Path
A simple path is a path in a graph which **does not have repeating vertices**.
* p has max **n-1** edges</mark>

### Non-Simple Path
A simple path is a path in a graph which **has repeating vertices**.

This means that given two vertices we can find multiple ways to go from the first to another.

### Unique Path
A unique path is path in which **there is only one way to get to a vertex from another**.

### Reachability
Reachability refers to the ability **to get from one vertex to another within a graph**.
* We say v is reachable from u, if there exists a path from u to v.

---

## Connectivity 
When we talk about connectivity and graphs we use the topological point of view.

### Connected Graph
A graph G=(V,E) is said to be connected i.f.f. there exists at least one path from u to v, for every u,v in E.
* In order to do this we need at least a certain number of edges for every graph.

Let G be an undirected graph G=(V,E), if G is also connected then:
* <mark>G is connected -> |E|>=|V|-1</mark> it is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition.
* The opposite is not necessarily true

Let G be an undirected graph G=(V,E)
* if <mark>deg(u‚ààV)>= (n-1)/2 -> G is connected</mark>

### Disconnected Graph
A graph that is not connected is said to be disconnected.

![ex disc path](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms/blob/main/Resources/exdiscpath.png?raw=TRUE)

### Connected Components - CC
A C.C. is a subset of vertices V'‚äÜ V, for which some properties stand true:
1. G[V'], the induced subgraph, is connected.
   1. If we take one component, the subgraph induced by the component is **connected**
2. V' is **not strictly contained** in a connected subset of V.
   1. Each component is **maximal**, is not contained in any larger subgraph, that also is connected.

Observation: The C.C. of a graph, are a partition of V.

### Complementary Graph
The complement or inverse of a graph G is a graph H on the same vertices such that two distinct vertices of H are adjacent 
if and only if they are not adjacent in G. That is, to generate the complement of a graph, one fills in all the missing 
edges required to form a complete graph, and removes all the edges that were previously there.

---

## Density
For a graph, the **density** is a real number ‚àà [0,1] given by the function `Œ¥(G) = |E|/max(E)`, with max(E) as the maximum number
of edges possibly existing for that particular graph. Let n = |V|, m = |E|

There are two main cases to distinguish in order to find max(E):
1. G is an **undirected graph**
   1. Œ¥(G) = m/binom(n,2) = <mark>`(2m)/(n(n-1))`</mark>
2. G is a **directed graph**
   1. Œ¥(G) = <mark>`m/n^2`</mark>

### Empty Graph
An empty graph is a graph G=(V,E), where E = ‚àÖ
* There can be vertices but **no edges**
* The density is 0

### Complete Graph
A complete graph is a graph G=(V,E), where E = V x V
* E contains **all the possible edges** between the vertices in V.
* It is trivially a connected graph. Although the opposite is not true. 
* The density is 1

Notation: a complete graph on **n vertices** is <mark>K(n)</mark>


### Clique
Let G be a graph such that, G=(V,E). A **clique** is a ùê∂ ‚äÜ V, a **subset of V where all the couples of edges
are connected by an edge in E** ùê∂ = {ùê∂ ‚äÜ V | ‚àÄu,v‚ààùê∂ -> ‚àÉ(u,v)‚ààE}.
* Any vertex inside the clique is connected with all the vertices inside the clique.
* If C is a clique, the induced subgraph G[ùê∂] is complete (the subgraph G restricted by C is complete).

**Maximal Clique**: a clique ùê∂‚äÜV which is not contained inside a larger clique.
* ‚àÑ clique D, C‚äÜD

**Maximum Clique**: a clique ùê∂‚äÜV with the maximum cardinality.
* a Maximum Clique is also Maximal, the opposite is not always true.

**Clique Number** œâ(G): the cardinality of its maximum clique

### Bipartite Graph
A graph G=(V,E) is bipartite if
* V = V(L) U V(R), V(L) ‚à© V(R) = ‚àÖ
    * Dividing V in two subsets V-left and V-right, which have no common vertex.
* G[V(L)], G[V(R)] are empty
    * The only edges present leave one vertex of a subset, and enters another vertex of the opposite vertex.
    * No edges between vertices of the same subset.

## Cyclicality
Cyclicality refers to the presence of a cycle in a graph.

### Cyclic Graph
A cyclic graph is a graph containing at least one graph cycle.
In other words, some number of vertices connected in a closed chain. 
* The cycle graph with n vertices is called Cn. 
* The number of vertices in Cn equals the number of edges
* Every vertex has degree 2
  * That is, every vertex has exactly two edges incident with it.

When it comes to directed graphs, there must be at least three vertices.

### Acyclic Graph / Forest
A graph that is not cyclic is said to be acyclic. 

Let G be an undirected graph G=(V,E), if G is also acyclic then:
* <mark>G is acyclic -> |E|<=|V|-1</mark>, too many edges cannot be placed without creating cycles
* The opposite is not necessarily true

### Unicyclic Graph
A cyclic graph possessing exactly one (undirected, simple) cycle is called a unicyclic graph.
