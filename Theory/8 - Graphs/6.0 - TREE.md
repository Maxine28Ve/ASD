## Free Tree
A free tree is an <mark>undirected, connected and acyclic graph G=(V,E)</mark>
* They are not the same as rooted trees, the hierarchical data structure we are used to.
* In fact, they **have no root nor hierarchy**.

So if <mark>G is a tree -> |E|=|V|-1</mark>
* Any edge we remove or add, will contradict the definition of tree
* They are fragile structures

### Theorem: property of free trees
Let G be an undirected graph G=(V,E), the following statements are ALL equivalent
between them:
1. G is a free tree
2. Any pair of vertices (u,v)∈V are connected by a unique path
3. G is connected but if any edge is removed, it becomes disconnected
4. G is connected and |E|=|V|-1
5. G is acyclic & |E|=|V|-1 imply that G is a free tree
6. G is acyclic but if any edge is added, it becomes cyclic

## Rooted Tree
A rooted tree is a pair (G, r) where:
* G is a free tree
* r is a vertex of the tree, called "root"
    * r ∈ V

## Forest
A forest is an acyclic graph.
A forest is a graph composed of a certain number of C.C.s, and each C.C. is a tree.
