# Graph Properties and Definitions pt3
Here we regroup some definitions which are fundamental to get started on graph theory.

## Graph Isomorphism
Let's consider two graphs $G_{1}=(V_{1},E_{1})$ and $G_{2}=(V_{2},E_{2})$

An isomorphism is a relation $\phi : V_{1} \rightarrow V_{2}$ between the vertices of
the first graph and those of the second one
1. It must be **bijective**
2. $\forall u,v ∈ V_{1}| (u,v) \in E_{1} \leftrightarrow (\phi (u), \phi (v)) \in E_{2}$
   1. The mapping preserves the adjacency between vertices of the same graph 
   2. if u1,v1 are connected through an edge, then u2,v2 must be too

We say that "$G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ are isomorphic", or $G_{1}  \simeq G_{2}$, if there is an isomorphism between $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$.

Here's an example:
![ex isomorphism](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms/blob/main/Resources/exisom.png?raw=TRUE)

So now, let's consider these two graphs: can we find an isomorphism?
```python
G1              |   G2
    (1)         |       (a)-(b)-(c)
  /     \       |
(3)     (2)     |

#This is an isomorphism G1 ≃ G2!
# ϕ(1) = a
# ϕ(2) = b
# ϕ(3) = c
```

Mind that there is **more than one isomorphism** 
* To this day, it is an NP-complete problem to verify if two graphs are
isomorphic. Nobody has found a solution in polynomial time.

From another point of view, it is relatively easy to find out whether two graphs 
G1, G2 are not isomorphic. Here are some properties that stand true but are not sufficient:
1. **|V1| = |V2|, |E1| = |E2|** are necessary (but not sufficient) conditions
2. ϕ(u∈V)∈V2 -> deg(u∈V) = deg(ϕ(u∈V))
   1. The **isomorphism maps vertices with the same degree**
3. **Degree Sequence**: given G=(V,E) is a sorted vector of length n=|V|, which means vertices are sorted 
   based on their degrees. 
   2. Two graphs are isomorphic if they have the same degree sequences, 
   **deg-seq(G1)=deg-seq(G2)** is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition
4. CC(G1) = CC(G2)
5. ω(G1) = ω(G2)
   1. Clique number are the same

There are many properties we could list but nothing helped to solve the problem.

## Cut
A Cut is a couple (S, V\S), S⊆V
* It is dividing a graph in two partitions

### A cut respects A
A cut (S, V\S) is said to respect A⊆E be a subset of edges for G(V,E), if not edges of A crosses the cut.

### Light edge
Light edge is defined with respect to a particular Cut.

Light edge (u,v)∈E, is an edge such that: 
* (u∈S & v∈{V\S}) OR (u∈{V\S} v∈S)
* w(u,v) <= w(x,y)
  * Minimum weight out of all the edges crossing the cut

### Safe Edge
Let A⊆E be a subset of edges, contained in some MST for G(V,E). 
Let's take and edge (u,v)∈E. 

The edge (u,v) is a Safe Edge for A if A∪{(u,v)} is contained in some MST too.
