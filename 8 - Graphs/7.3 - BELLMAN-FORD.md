# Bellman-Ford
The Bellman-Ford algorithm solves the single-source shortest-paths problem on a weighted,
directed graph G=(V,E) in the general case in which edge weights may be negative.
The algorithm **returns a boolean value** indicating whether there is a negative-weight 
cycle that is reachable from the source. 
* If there is such a cycle, the algorithm indicates that no solution exists. 
* If there is no such cycle, the algorithm produces the shortest paths and their weights.

## Data Structures
No relevant data structure to analyze, we can use either arrays or queues. This choice would not impact the outcome of the 
complexity.

## Algorithm
It is composed of two parts:
1) The first part is the main algorithm
   1) It performs n-1 brute force iterations, where it executes RELAX() on all edges of the graph. Basically,
   it consists of <mark>n-1 relaxations on all edges.</mark>
      1) Dijkstra only iterates through all edges once (m iterations).
2) The second part aims at locating the existence of negative cycles

```python
BELLMAN_FORD(Graph G, Weight w, Vertex s)
    for(i=1 to |G.V|-1):
        for((u,v) in G.E):
            RELAX(u,v, w(u,v));
    for((u,v) in G.E):
        if(d[v]>d[u]+w(u,v)):
            return (False, d, π);
    return (True, d, π); #No negative cycles
```
**Final Time Complexity**: T(n) = <mark>**Θ(nm)**</mark> = Θ(n + (n-1)m + m)

### 1 - Complexity Demonstration
1) INIT_SS(): T(n) = Θ(n)
2) First Part: T(n) = O(n-1 * m)
   1) For: T(n) = O(n-1)
   2) For each: T(n) = O(m)
      1) RELAX(): T(n) = O(1)
3) Second Part: T(n) = O(m)
   1) For each: T(n) = O(m)
      1) Check: T(n) = O(1)

#### BF vs Dijkstra

![bfdj comp](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms/blob/main/Resources/bfdjcomp.png?raw=TRUE)

BF is more efficient when it comes to using data structures (maintaining a PQ is more expensive).
Even though Dijkstra is a better fit almost always, we have can use BF more generally.

### 2 - Correctness Demonstration: BF's correctness theorem.
The theorem is divided into two parts. We distinguish the cases where:
1) The graph excludes negative cycles
2) The graph includes negative cycles

### Graph - Neg. Cycles excluded
Let's execute B.F. on a graph G=(V,E, `w:E->R`) with s as source vertex s∈V. If G excludes negative cycles
reachable from s, at the end of the algorithm the following statements stay true:
1) d[u] = δ(s,u) ∀u∈V 
2) Gπ is a shortest-path tree
3) The algorithm returns `True`

#### Demonstration - cases 1, 3
Case 1: If we take a generic vertex u∈V, we have three cases
1) δ(s,u)=+inf(), trivial
2) δ(s,u) is a real number
   1) ∃ p(s,u), there exists **at least one** path between s and u, so there **must exist a shortest-path**
   (we do not have negative cycles) that is simple, right? 
      1) We cannot say for sure, since if we had a cycle along p whose weight equals to 0, it still would be a SP.
   2) We can always find a path p that is a **simple** shortest-path between s and u, inside the whole set of SP.
      1) There must be at least one!
      2) If p is simple, then <mark>p has max **n-1** edges</mark>
3) ~~δ(s,u)=-inf()~~. Impossible, there are no negative cycles

To prove the second point, let's apply the convergence property on repeat:
`x0 = s` -> `x1` -> `x2` -> ... -> `xq = u`
* d[s] = 0 = δ(s,s)
* RELAX() on all edges
  * RELAX(s, x1, w(s,x1)), since we are on a SP, d[x1] = δ(s,x1)
  * RELAX(s, x2, w(s,x2)), d[x2] = δ(s,x2)
  * And so on, until it reaches the last vertex. When it comes to q, we only need n-1 iterations 
  because we are on SP. RELAX(s, u, w(s,u)) -> d[u]=δ(s,u)

Case 3: The algorithm returns `True` when there are no negative cycles. 
It can be trivially explained by triangular inequality and the demonstration for the case 1.
1) When `d[v] <= d[u]+w(u,v)1` for all edges, the algorithm returns True.
2) δ(s,v) <= δ(s,v)+w(u,v), by triangular property
   1) d[v]<= d[u]+w(u,v), by equality

### Graph - Neg. Cycles included
If in G there are negative cycles reachable from s, at the end of the algorithm the following 
statements stay true: The algorithm returns `False`.

#### Demonstration - Ad Absurdum
Hypothesis, IF there exists a negative cycle reachable from source s. Thesis: THEN BF -> FALSE.

We assume that even though there exists a negative cycle reachable from source s, BF -> TRUE.
1) Returning TRUE means that when `d[v] <= d[u]+w(u,v)1`, for all edges.
2) Let's call `c = <x0, x1, ..., xq>, with x0 = xq` a negative cycle reachable from s. 
   1) `sum(w(xi-1, xi), i=1 to q) < 0`
3) If the point 1 stands true for all edges, we can say that for all i=1 to q, `d[xi]<=d[xi-1]+w(xi-1, xi)`
   1) By summing everything we would obtain: `sum(d[xi], i=1 to q) <= sum(d[xi-1], i=1 to q)+sum(w(xi-1, xi), i=1 to q)`
   2) However, we find out that `sum(d[xi], i=1 to q) = sum(d[xi-1], i=1 to q)` since,
      1) d[x1]+d[x2]+d[x3]+ ... + d[xq-1] + d[xq] <= d[x0]+d[x1]+d[x2]+d[x3]+ ... + d[xq-1]
      2) By taking out the common members we have, d[xq] <= d[x0]
      3) However, we know xq=x0 since this is a cycle! 
   3) This results in `0 <= sum(w(xi-1, xi), i=1 to q)`, which is absurd!

## Conclusions
Best to be used when there are no negative cycles, but can be used with negative weights!
