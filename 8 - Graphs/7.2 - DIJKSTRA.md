# Dijkstra
Dijkstra’s greedy algorithm solves the single-source shortest-paths problem on a weighted,
directed graph G=(V,E) for the case in which all edge weights are non-negative
* We assume that w(u,v)>=0 ∀(u,v)∈E

## Data Structures
We find here a Priority Queue **Q** of **vertices** which have **not been selected yet**
and have the key field **d**, the smaller, the more promising they are.

Dijkstra’s algorithm also maintains a set S of vertices whose final shortest-path
weights from the source s have already been determined.

## Algorithm
1. Initialization
2. The algorithm repeatedly selects the vertex u∈{V\S}S with the minimum shortest-path estimate (d)
3. Adds u to S
4. Relaxes all edges leaving u
5. Stops when Q is empty
6. Returns
   1. d, the vector containing the estimations
   2. Gπ, predecessor subgraph

```python
Dijkstra(Graph G, Weight w, Vertex s)
    INIT_SS(G, s)
    Q <- G.V
    S = ∅
    while(Q != ∅):
        u <- EXTRACT_MIN(Q); 
        S <- S ∪ {u};
        for(v in Adj[u]): #Relax every leaving vertex.
            RELAX(u, v, w(u,v));
    return (d, Gπ);
```
**Final Time Complexity**: T(n) = <mark>**O(m * log(n))**</mark>
* Always ends because the while cycle extracts every time a vertex and
the for cycle is always ending.


### 1 - Complexity Demonstration

#### A) Q is an Array - Best for dense graph
**Final Time Complexity**: T(n) = O(n**2) = <mark>O(n) + O(n **2) + O(m)</mark>
* n < n**2
* m <= n**2

1. Initialization: Θ(n)
   1. INIT_SS(): Θ(n)
2. While block: O(n^2)
   1. WHILE * EXTRACT_MIN(): Θ(n)
      1. Unordered array, so the worst is to look through n elements.
   2. FOR * RELAX(): O(m * 1) = sum(out-deg(u), u in V) * T(1)
      1. Executes RELAX a number of times equal to the out-degree of the vertex

#### B) Q is a binary heap - Best for sparse graph
**Final Time Complexity**: T(n) = O(m * log(n)) = <mark>O(n) + O(n * log(n)) + O(m * log(m))</mark>
* If the graph is connected, m*log(n)

1. Initialization: Θ(n)
2. While block: O(m * log(n))
   1. WHILE * EXTRACT_MIN(): Θ(n * log(n))
   2. FOR * RELAX(): O(m * log(n)) = sum(out-deg(u), u in V) * T(RELAX())

### 2 - Correctness Demonstration: Theorem of Dijkstra
Let G=(V,E, `w:E->R`) be an undirected, **positive-edge-weighted** graph and s∈V 
is the source vertex.
* <mark>w(u,v)>=0</mark> ∀(u,v)∈E

When Dijkstra's algorithm stops we have:
1. d[u] = δ(s,v) ∀u∈V
   1. Necessarily, the distances will be equal to the estimates
2. Gπ is a shortest-path tree (which is a consequence of point 1)

What we are saying is during the extraction of the vertex u from Q (u∈V), the property
d[u]=δ(s,u) stands true. How do we know this stands true until the algorithm stops?

We know that if the property stands true during extraction, since d[u] reached 
the inferior limit, it will not be changed afterwards.

Ad absurdum, let's say we have a vertex ∃u∈V such that during extraction d[u]!=δ(s,u) 
(we are negating are thesis). Furthermore, u is the **first vertex** where this happens.

Let's make some observations:
1) u!=s, u cannot be the source vertex
   1) After INIT_SS(), d[s] =  δ(s,s)
      1) It is not always true, if s is to be found on a negative cycle, d[s]=0 and δ(s,s)=-inf()
      2) But by hypothesis, all weights are positive
2) During extraction S!=Ø, since s∈S has been extracted already (it is the first one)
   1) So there have been some vertices that have been extracted already
3) Prior to extracting u from Q which is Q={V\S}, we have two cases
   1) Case 1: δ(s,u) = +inf(), there is no path, so δ(s,u) = +inf() = d[u], and surely it is not the vertex
   we were looking for.
   2) Case 2: There exists a shortest-path p between s and u. 
      1) p includes an edge (x,y) with x∈S, y∈Q, that crosses the cut between S and Q
      2) d[x]=δ(s,x), since x has been already extracted and _by hypothesis_ only u violates the 
      property.
      3) d[y]=δ(s,y), by the _convergence property_
         1) (s,u) is a shortest-path, and we know that sub-paths of shortest-paths are also
         shortest-paths
      4) d[u]<=d[y], if Dijkstra decides to extract u before y, by construction of Dijkstra
         1) Both u and y have not been extracted yet. 
      5) δ(s,y)<=δ(s,u), trivially by hypothesis of positive weights.
      6) δ(s,u)<=d[u], by inferior limit

Let's consider all the pieces of the puzzle now:
1) δ(s,u)<=d[u], By 3.2.6 (the inferior limit).
2) δ(s,u)<=d[u]<=d[y], By 3.2.4
3) δ(s,u)<=δ(s,y)
4) δ(s,u)<=δ(s,y)<=δ(s,u)
5) d[u]=δ(s,u), which is **absurd**

#### CPU Improvement
Exercises:
1. What would happen if the algorithm extracts n-1 vertices?
2. We execute the RELAX() even on edges that lead to vertices we have already extracted.
   What if did not consider those edges?
3. We are given a directed graph G=(V,E) on which each edge (u,v) has an
   associated value r(u,v) which is a real number in the range 0<=r(u,v)<=1 that
   represents the reliability of a communication channel from vertex u to vertex.
   We interpret r(u,v) as the probability that the channel from u to  will not fail,
   and we assume that these probabilities are independent. Give an efficient algorithm
   to find the most reliable path between two given vertices. (Solution Lesson 04/12/2022)

#### Problems
What to do if G has negative weights? There is nothing that ensures the algorithm is going
to work properly 100% of the time

## Conclusions
Best to be used when there are no negative weights nor negative cycles
