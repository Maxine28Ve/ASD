# Dijkstra
Dijkstra’s algorithm solves the single-source shortest-paths problem on a weighted,
directed graph G=(V,E) for the case in which all edge weights are non-negative
* We assume that w(u,v)>=0 ∀(u,v)∈E

## Data Structures
We find here a Priority Queue **Q** of **vertices** which have **not been selected yet**
and have the key field **d**, the smaller, the more promising they are.

Dijkstra’s algorithm also maintains a set S of vertices whose final shortest-path
weights from the source s have already been determined.

## Algorithm
1. Initialization
2. The algorithm repeatedly selects the vertex u∈{V\S}S with the minimum shortest-path estimate (d)
3. Adds u to S
4. Relaxes all edges leaving u
5. Stops when Q is empty
6. Returns
   1. d, the vector containing the estimations
   2. Gπ, predecessor subgraph

```python
Dijkstra(Graph G, Weight w, Vertex source)
    INIT_SS(G, s)
    Q = V[G]
    S = ∅
    while(Q != ∅):
        u = EXTRACT_MIN(Q); 
        S = S ∪ {u};
        for(Vertex v in Adj[u]): #Relax every leaving vertex.
            RELAX(u, v, w);
    return (d, Gπ);
```
**Final Time Complexity**: T(n) = <mark>**O(m * log(n))**</mark>
* Always ends because the while cycle extracts every time a vertex and
the for cycle is always ending.


### 1 - Complexity Demonstration

#### A) Q is an Array - Best for dense graph
**Final Time Complexity**: T(n) = O(n**2) = <mark>O(n) + O(n **2) + O(m)</mark>
* n < n**2
* m <= n**2

1. Initialization, T(n) = Θ(n)
2. EXTRACT_MIN(), T(n) = O(n**2)
   1. For, depends on out-degree, 
3. RELAX(), T(m) = m 
   1. Dijkstra executes RELAX a number of times equal to the out-degree of the 
   vertex, which is **m**= sum(out-deg(u), u in V)
   

#### B) Q is a binary heap - Best for sparse graph
**Final Time Complexity**: T(n) = O(m * log(n)) = <mark>O(n) + O(n * log(n)) + O(m * log(m))</mark>
* If the graph is connected, m*log(n)

1. Initialization, T(n) = Θ(n)
2. EXTRACT_MIN(), T(n) = O(n*log(n))
   1. While, O(n)
   2. EXTRACT_MIN, O(log(n))
3. RELAX(), T(m) = O(log(m))
   1. For, O(m) 
   2. Dijkstra executes RELAX a number of times equal to the out-degree of the
      vertex, which is **log(m)**= sum(out-deg(u), u in V)
      1. The second operation, could provoke a rebalancing of the binary heap
