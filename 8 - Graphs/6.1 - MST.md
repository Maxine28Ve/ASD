# Minimum Spanning Trees

## Spanning Trees
We can apply this concept to undirected, connected graphs G=(V,E).
A spanning tree is a **tree** T=(V,E') where <mark>subset E'⊆ E such that, 
all vertices are reached by these edges.</mark>

## MST
Let G be an undirected, connected, weighted graph G=(V,E, w), where w is a weight function
`w:E->R`. 

A tree T⊆E, is a MST, if the weight of the tree <mark>`W(T) = sum(w(u,v), (u,v)∈T)`</mark> is one of
the minimum spanning trees out of all the spanning trees

In fact, the minimality factor implies the fact we are working with weighted graphs.

If a graph is connected i.f.f. there exists at least one MST for that graph.

### Algorithm for MST: crucial fact of MST
Our focus will be primarily on the SMT search. 
Two very famous algorithms for this are **Kruskal** and **Prim**.

But what do all algorithms of SMT search have in common?
If we execute a cut on a graph, and we take a light edge crossing the cut, 
**there exists a MST containing that light edge**.

### Sew and Cut technique 
Let's consider a T, a generic MST of G, and suppose there is an edge (u,v) in 
the cut. We can have now this scenario.
* (u,v)∈T
* (u,v)∉T

With this technique we can construct another MST that contains the edge, from
the Tree T (which does not contain the edge (u,v) ).
1. Let's sew: T ∪{(u,v)} 
   1. We have now a cyclic graph.
   2. (x,y)∈E is the cycle created, which crosses the cut
2. Let's cut: <mark>T' = T ∪{(u,v)}\{(x,y)}</mark> is a MST.
   1. W(T') = W(T), with W(T) is a MST.

## Generic MST
Let's start with an incremental general algorithm thought to find MSTs for a graph.

Input:
* G, the graph
* w, a vector containing the weights

Output:
* an MST

Steps:
1. Construct a set A that will contain the edges of the MST 
2. While |A| < |V| − 1
3. Find a safe edge for A(u,v)
4. Add it to A
6. Return A

```python
Generic_MST(G, w)
    A[] = ⊘; #Empty Set
    while (|A| < |V| − 1):
        #find a safe edge for A (𝑢, 𝑣) ∈ 𝐸
        𝐴 ← 𝐴 ∪ {(𝑢, 𝑣)}
    return A;
```

Since the third step is not clear, we cannot really implement it. Mind that,
this is only an example and the algorithms we are going to see are mere variations.

## Fundamental Theorem of MST
To introduce this theorem we must mind the following definitions:
1. Cut (S, V\S) S⊆V
2. Light Edge
3. Safe Edge

Let G=(V,E, w) an undirected, connected, weighted graph, if:
1. **A⊆E**, that is included in some MST for G.
2. **(S, {V\S})** be any cut of G that **respects A**
   1. No edge of A crosses (S, {V\S})
3. **(u,v)∈E** be a light edge crossing the cut (S, {V\S})

Then, **edge (u,v) is safe for A**
* **A∪{(u,v)}** is included in some MST

This helps find a starting point to finish the algorithm we have previously
tried to implement!

Dim: Let T∈E be a MST including A. We have two cases
1. (u,v)∈T
   1. We stop here, since we found a tree where A ∪ {(u,v)} ⊆ T is an MST
2. (u,v)∉T
   1. We proceed like in the see&cut technique
   2. We sew: T ∪ {(u,v)}
      1. The result is a cycle
   3. We cut: T' = T ∪{(u,v)}\{(x,y)}, which is an MST
      1. T' is an ST
      2. W(T') = W(T)
         1. W(T)<=W(T'), because T is an MST
         2. W(T')<=W(T), because W(T')=W(T)+W((u,v))-W(x,y)
            1. W((u,v))-W(x,y)<=0 because W((u,v))<=W(x,y) since (u,v) is a light edge
   4. We need to find whether A∪{(u,v)} ⊆ T', with T' being an MST
      1. (u,v)⊆ T', is true by construction 
      2. A⊆ T', is true
         1. If (x,y)⊆A then we cannot prove our point
         2. But, we know the cut respects A, by hypothesis
         3. So, surely (x,y) crosses the cut and (x,y)∉A

#### Observation 1:
w(u,v) = w(x,y), they have the same weight!
* Since T was an MST, but also T' is an MST. 

This means there these edges are both light edges, with the same weight, and both cross the cut.
* If we have a graph, with different weights for each edge, and we execute a cut the light edge is obviously
unique
* Trivially, when we "Sew" we have at least two light edges. But here there is only one!

#### Observation 2:
Given a cut (S, {V\S}), with S⊆V. 
* If the light edge (u,v) crossing the cut, is unique
* Then, all MST include (u,v)

#### Corollary 23.2[CLRS]:
Let G=(V,E) be a connected, undirected graph with a 
real-valued weight function w defined on E. 
* Let A⊆E, included in some minimum spanning tree for G
* Let C=(V(C), E(C)) be a connected component (tree) in the
  forest G(A) = (V,A)
* If (u,v) is a light edge connecting C to some other component in G(A)

Then (u,v) is safe for A
