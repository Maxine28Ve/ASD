# Shortest Path
Edge weights can represent metrics other than distances, such as time, cost,
penalties, loss, or any other quantity that accumulates linearly along a path and
that we would want to minimize.
* We do not exclude negative real-valued weights, and some algorithms only work with positive numbers.

In a shortest-paths problem, we are given a **weighted, directed** graph G=(V,E, w) where
w is a weight function `w:E -> R` mapping edges to real-valued weights.
* The weight of a path p, w(p) = `sum(w(v(i-1), v(i)), i = 1 to k)`

It is a problem that mainly concerns directed graphs. However, it can be easily applied to
undirected graphs by converting their edges into couples of edges pointing in opposite directions.

The **shortest-path weight** δ(u,v) from u to v is defined as:
* min(w(p)) with p∈**C**(u,v), if **there is a path** from u to v
  * C(u,v)={p|p is a path from u and v}
* +inf(), otherwise
  * C(u,v)={∅}
