# Shortest Path Properties

## Sub-paths property
<mark>Sub-paths of shortest-paths, are also shortest-paths</mark>

Example: Let's imagine a shortest-path between u, v. If we take
two more vertices x,y which are in between them and are included in the
path, the path going from x to y is also a shortest-path between them.

#### Demonstration

Let 
* u,v∈V be two vertices
* p = <x0, x1, ..., xq> is a **shortest-path** 
  * x0 = u, xq = v with (x(i-1), xi)∈E ∀i = 1...q

Let's take two vertices x(i), x(j) with `0<=i<=j<=q` 

![ex subpdem](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms/blob/main/Resources/exsubpdem.jpg?raw=TRUE)

We suppose, by absurd, that the path between x(i) and x(j) is not a shortest-path
* So there exist another path which total weight is lower.
* This means that between u and v there is also a shorter path, strictly 
smaller than the original shortest-path
* There can be many shortest-path with the same weight

## Decomposition of distance δ

Let's take s∈V and v∈V, and suppose that p is a **shortest-path** p(s,v).
* u∈V is the second-last vertex in the path p(s,v).
  * In a way that there is a direct edge between **(u,v)** and (u,v)∈p(s,v)

Then the distance `δ(s,v) =  δ(s,u) + w(u,v)`

#### Demonstration
Let's call 
* p = δ(s,v)
* p' = δ(s,u)

As we know from the **Sub-paths property**, the sub-path p' is a shortest-path

Then: δ(s,v) = w(p) = w(p')+ w((u,v)) = δ(s,u) + w((u,v))
* p(s,u) is a shortest-path between s and u.
* w(p') is the distance δ(s,u)

## Triangular Inequality
For any edge (u,v)∈E in a graph, we have `δ(s,v)<= δ(s,u)+w(u,v)`

#### Demonstration
