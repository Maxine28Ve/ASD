# Shortest Path Properties

## Sub-paths property
<mark>Sub-paths of shortest-paths, are also shortest-paths</mark>

Example: Let's imagine a shortest-path between u, v. If we take
two more vertices x,y which are in between them and are included in the
path, the path going from x to y is also a shortest-path between them.

#### Demonstration

Let 
* u,v∈V be two vertices
* p = <x0, x1, ..., xq> is a **shortest-path** 
  * x0 = u, xq = v with (x(i-1), xi)∈E ∀i = 1...q

Let's take two vertices x(i), x(j) with `0<=i<=j<=q` 

![ex subpdem](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms/blob/main/Resources/exsubpdem.jpg?raw=TRUE)

We suppose, by absurd, that the path between x(i) and x(j) is not a shortest-path
* So there exist another path which total weight is lower.
* This means that between u and v there is also a shorter path, strictly 
smaller than the original shortest-path
* There can be many shortest-path with the same weight

## Decomposition of distance δ

Let's take s∈V and v∈V, and suppose that p is a **shortest-path** p(s,v).
* u∈V is the second-last vertex in the path p(s,v).
  * In a way that there is a direct edge between **(u,v)** and (u,v)∈p(s,v)

Then the distance `δ(s,v) =  δ(s,u) + w(u,v)`

#### Demonstration
Let's call 
* p = δ(s,v)
* p' = δ(s,u)

As we know from the **Sub-paths property**, the sub-path p' is a shortest-path

Then: δ(s,v) = w(p) = w(p')+ w((u,v)) = δ(s,u) + w((u,v))
* p(s,u) is a shortest-path between s and u.
* w(p') is the distance δ(s,u)

---

## Triangle Inequality (Lemma 24.10 )
For any edge (u,v)∈E in a graph, we have `δ(s,v)<= δ(s,u)+w(u,v)`

#### Demonstration
* Case 1: A path (s,u) does NOT exist, **δ(s,u) = +inf()** 
  1. Only because (s,u) does not exist, this does not imply that (s,v) should not exist
  2. δ(s,v) <= +inf() 
  3. δ(s,v) <= δ(s,u) + w(u,v)
* Case 2: A path (s,u) exists, but along the way there is a negative cycle, **δ(s,u) = -inf()**
  1. δ(s,u) = -inf(), so δ(s,v) = -inf() too, since there is a negative cycle on the way.
  2. δ(s,v) = -inf()
  3. δ(s,v) = δ(s,u) + w(u,v)
* Case 3: A **shortest-path (s,u) exists**, δ(s,u) is a real number.
  1. δ(s,u)∈*R*
  2. δ(s,v) is a shortest-path, so δ(s,v)<= length of any path (s,v)
     1. However, only because (s,u) is a shortest-path, this does not imply (s,v) is too
  3. δ(s,v) <= w(p) + w(u,v)
  4. δ(s,v) <=  δ(s,u) + w(u,v)

## Introduction of Data Structure use
Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford algorithms use the fields d[u], π[u] ∀u∈V for two procedures.
1. Initialization for all vertices
2. Update: Relax procedure.
   1. Relax, it slowly decreases the value of the field d, until it reaches a limit (the distance)

## Init Single Source (INIT_SS)
Initialization at the beginning:
* π[u] = NULL
* d[u] = +inf()
  * d[source] = 0;

```python
INIT_SS(Graph G, Node s)
    for(u in V[G]):
        d[u] = +inf();
        π[u] = NULL;
    d[s] = 0;
```

## Relax (RELAX)
It is an operation on the edges: ∀(u,v)∈E. If an edge does not exist, I cannot call the 
procedure on that edge.
1. If the estimate on the vertex v **is worse** (larger) than the estimate of vertex u and the
edge's weight together.
   1. Then, we can improve this estimate and update the fields to find a better path. Since
   we found evidence of a better path.

```python
RELAX(Vertex u, Vertex v, Weight w(u,v))
    if(d[v] > d[u]+w(u,v)): # Worse Estimate Case
        d[u] = d[u] + w(u,v);
        π[u] = u;
```

![ex relax](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms/blob/main/Resources/exrelax.png?raw=TRUE)

### Properties of Relax
After RELAX(u,v, w(u,v)), we always find **d[v]<=d[u]+w(u,v)**
* If we enter the *then branch*, obviously d[v]=d[u]+w(u,v)
* Else, obviously d[v]<=d[u]+w(u,v)

### Property of inferior limit/ Upper-bound property (Lemma 24.11)
If we initialize the structures with a INIT_SS operation, for any RELAX sequence, 
1. we have **δ(s,u)<= d[u], ∀u∈V**
2. The _real_ distance between s and u is always inferior or equal to the estimate d[u]
  * So the real distance represents an inferior limit for d[u].
3. Moreover, if after a RELAX δ(s,u) = d[u], no other RELAX can change that value.

#### Demonstration of Upper-bound property (Lemma 24.11)
1. This property is always true after INIT_SS()
   1. Case: `u!=s`, d[u] = +inf() and δ(s,u)<= d[u]
   2. Case: `u==s`, d[s] = 0
      1. If the source node is to be found in a negative cycle, δ(s,s) = -inf() <= 0
      2. If the source node is not to be found in a negative cycle, δ(s,s) = 0 = d[s]
      3. δ(s,u)<= d[u] 
2. Let's imagine, this property is violated by some RELAX(), ∃v∈V such that after a RELAX d[v]<δ(s,v). 
Moreover, let's add the fact that this is the **first time** the property is violated by a RELAX() (the RELAX before did not violate it). 
We know that RELAX() either does nothing or updates **only the destination vertex's fields**.
   After that RELAX() we have:
      1. d[u]+w(u,v) = d[v]
      2. d[u]+w(u,v) < δ(s,v), by hypothesis
      3. d[u]+w(u,v) <= δ(s,u) + w(u,v), for the triangular inequality
      4. d[u] < δ(s,u), which is absurd, since the RELAX() does not change anything in the source vertex's fields, this must have
   been true before the RELAX(), which is absurd.
3. If after a RELAX δ(s,u) = d[u], no other RELAX can change that value.
   1. It surely cannot lower the value of d[u] because it reached the inferior limit
   2. It cannot raise its value either because RELAX() can only lower it, by construction.

### No-Path Property (Corollary 24.12)
If ∄ a path between s and u, which we know equals to stating δ(s,u) = +inf(), then
after the INIT_SS we have d[u] = δ(s,u) = +inf()

### Convergence Property (Lemma 24.14)
If **s↝u→v** is a shortest path in G for some u,v∈V and if d[u] = δ(s,u) at any time
prior to relaxing edge (u,v), d[v] = δ(s,v) at all times afterward.

### Predecessor-Subgraph Property (Lemma 24.17)
If we have that, at the end of an algorithm using the RELAX every estimate d are all correct, 
**d[u] = δ(s,u) ∀u∈V**, the predecessor subgraph Gπ is a shortest-paths tree rooted at s.
