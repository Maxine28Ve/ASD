# Shortest Path Properties

## Sub-paths property
Sub-paths of shortest-paths, are also shortest-paths

Example:

![ex subp](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms/blob/main/Resources/exsubp.jpg?raw=TRUE)

Demonstration: 

Let 
* u,v∈V be two vertices
* p = <x0, x1, ..., xq> is a **shortest-path** 
  * x0 = u, xq = v with (x(i-1), xi)∈E ∀i = 1...q

Let's take two vertices x(i), x(j) with `0<=i<=j<=q` 

![ex subpdem](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms/blob/main/Resources/exsubpdem.jpg?raw=TRUE)

We suppose, by absurd, that the path between x(i) and x(j) is not a shortest-path
* So there exist another path which total weight is lower.
* This means that between u and v there is also a shorter path, strictly 
smaller than the original shortest-path
* There can be many shortest-path with the same weight
