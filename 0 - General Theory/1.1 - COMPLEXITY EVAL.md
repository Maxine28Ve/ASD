# Complexity Evaluation
Let's see how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm give its computations.

$$T(n)$$

## Blocks
Sequence of blocks

```c++
{
    block1{};
    ...
    blockn{};
}
```

$$T(n) = block_{1} + ... + block_{n} = f(n) + ... + z(n) $$

## Branches
Evaluating branches

```c++
{
    if( f(n) ){
        block1{}
    }else{
        block2{}
    }
}
```

$$T(n) = \operatorname{Max}\{ if, else \} + f(n) $$
