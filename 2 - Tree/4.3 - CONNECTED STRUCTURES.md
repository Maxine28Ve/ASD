# CS - Left Child, Right Sibling
CS is an implementation of tree having the same premise as the structure [LCP Tree](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/ASD/blob/main/2%20-%20Tree/4.2%20-%20CONNECTED%20STRUCTURES.md)

Constraints:
* **Binarized**: has only two pointers
* Used for: _General Tree_ implementation

Example:

![LCRS](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/ASD/blob/main/Resources/LCRS-Tree.jpg?raw=TRUE)

## Data
Every **node** of the tree is composed of:
* x.key, info
* x.p, pointer to parent
* **x.left_child**, pointer to leftmost child
  * If it is leaf node, x.left_child = NULL
* **x.right_sibling**, pointer to the first sibling on the right (of a node x).
  * If it is the leftmost node, x.right_sibling = NULL

We can iterate through siblings or parents.

Space Complexity: S(n) = O(n)

---

## Parent
Same as LCP Tree.

---

## Children

```python
children(Tree t, Node v)
    l = create_list();
    iter = v.left_child;
    while(iter != NULL):
        insert(iter, l);
        iter = iter.right_sibling;
    return l;
```
**Final Time Complexity**: T(n) = <mark>O(degree(ùë£))</mark>

---

## Generic Visit

```python
generic_visit(Node r)
    s = r
    while (s != NULL):
        # Extract a node u from S
        # Visit the node u
        s = s U children(u)
```
**Final Time Complexity**: T(n) = <mark>O(n)</mark>
