# CS - List of Pointers to Children
Implementation of Tree to use when we <mark> do not know A-PRIORI the count of children</mark> 
of a specific node.

We find two types of nodes here:
1. First Type of Node
   1. Field with info
   2. Pointer to a **list** of its children
2. Second Type of Node:
   1. Pointer to a node
   2. Pointer to a node of type *list of children*

Example:

## Conclusion

By implementing a tree in this way, we can represent an arbitrary number of children with the downside of having two different
kinds of nodes.
