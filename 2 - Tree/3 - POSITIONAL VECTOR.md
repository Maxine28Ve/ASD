# Positional Vector
We specifically use this type of implementation with **Complete K-Ary Trees** with `k>=2`

Every node has a specific position inside the structure.

Let **T = (N, A)** be a complete k-ary tree with n nodes.
 * Leaves have the same depth
 * Every node has k children

## Data
We use a vector v, of length n.

### Conclusion
Pro: We can find in constant time the position of the parent and children of each node.

Con:
