# Max Clique Problem
It is a problem for undirected, non-weighted graphs G=(V,E).

---

## Clique
Let G be a graph such that, G=(V,E). A clique **C⊆V**, is a **subset of V** such that any **vertex inside the
clique is connected with all the vertices inside the clique**. 
* This means for any pair of vertices in V, there exists an edge connecting them. 
* If C is a clique, G[C] is complete (the subgraph G restricted by C is complete).

## Maximal Clique
A clique is maximal if it is **not contained inside a larger clique**.
* ∄ clique D, C⊆D
* Maximal clique does not imply it is also a maximum clique

## Maximum Clique
If the cardinality of C, **|C|**, is the **largest out of all possible cliques**.
* Maximum clique implies it is also a maximal clique
